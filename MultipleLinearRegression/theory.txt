### you dont have to worry about :

#### a) MLRM ASSUMPTIONS 

is dataset is following asssumptions from the MLRM if data is not linear so it will 
give bad performance <br>and on basis of that you can say that dataset is not following 
assumptions or not

#### b) DUMMY VARIABLE TRAP

no model will take care of it automatically

#### c) BEST FEATURE SELECTION 

no model will also take care of that
