in logistic regression of feature scaling not worth anything

We need to perform Feature Scaling when we are dealing with Gradient Descent Based algorithms 

(Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Network) and Distance-based algorithms (KNN, K-means, SVM) 

as these are very sensitive to the range of the data points
