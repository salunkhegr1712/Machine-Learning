here inside this i will write the notes which i take from the data science and by learning the modules of python which are 
quiet usefull when you are going to apply them inside the machine learning

# Data Science

it is science of data in which you have data on something with the use of data we are going find out some inference with is
so that science which dignose the data and drew out the inference is callled as the data science 

# Ipynb file format

it is a utility of python with with we can able to create differnt section of code and it will help you to do any thing seperatly 
irrespective any earlier code. 

note : we are going to use the ipynb directly with VS code  and not going to use the jupyter notebook

about notebook

1) in each notebook the number in [ ] will show you current count of the code which is runned just so from that you can 
able to fidn in what order the code is runned 

2) so if you want to run some terminal command inside ipynb file so it will just need ! in start of command and then whole
sentense after it will be seen as the terminal command
it is very usefull when we have download some packages in python 

ex :
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install numpy
!echo "ghansham"
!mkdir helloGrs  

same command with ! at start will lead to error 

3) Ipynb will also able to store the output so you dont have run each and every code each time which will save your time and 
efforts and also will increase the productivity 

4) there are multiple ways of use multiple language with the help of the jupyter magic and it will found very usefull for you
to run the code of differnt languages 
use code !lsmagic

you can use them with % and vs code will show you multiple magic item and you can use them too
there are chances of system to hang so use it wisely
