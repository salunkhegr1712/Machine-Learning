# Machine Learning [ML]

machine learning is process in which we want to teach machine something and
machine will be able to study on the basis of the data given and able to produce the output 
when some data of similar type is given to machine to evaluate

# Artificial Intelligence [AI]

it is process of making machine thinks like the human and able to learn by there own just like human learn
on there own and as human has own natural intelligence so human are trying to give such intelligence to machine 
and such of the intelligence is called as the artificial intelligence and it is field under development and
has allot of scope inside it 

# We use python mostly for ML but Why ??

python is easy.
python is fast enough to run machine learning algorithm and codes
python has large source of the machine learning modules.
python is cross platform language (run on any OS )


# how machine learning works 

machine Learning is used on data so that the machine which fetch the data and then it will be able to 
find out the set of rules from that data and then with use of that rules we can able to solve problems 
of type of same data 

# features in Machine Learning

so everything which can describe about a object or person or item is called as the features

ex: a cat has 2 eyes, 4 legs, 1 tails, nails in legs so all of these are the features of a cat and all this can
able to describe how a cat looks so all these legs, eyes, nose all are the features of the cat and 
on the basis of that we are able to uniquely identify the cat in between the animals

# label in Machine Learning

so when you provide features inside a machine so machine will evaluate it on basis of rules produced and
output for the inputed features are called as the label

ex : you provide features of cat like hairs,eyes,legs, so machine will detect and deduce result like the
features are corrosponds to cat so so label to that docs will be cat 

label is like the outcome of the machine on basis of rules which machine give
machine learning algo is one which maps the features(input to machine learning algorithm) to the label 
(outcome after applying rules sets inside the machine learning algorithm)

example :
    you have find is a cat is happy or sad

say features are f1 f2 f3 and label are l1 l2
    we use mathematics inference such a way that

    features                    label
    f1 : eyes               l1 : angry
    f2 : legs               l2 : happy
    f3 : Mouth

    such like that we are able to provide some outcome via mathematics inference and machine learning algos


# importance of data in machine learning
 
To play with model and machine learning the most important thing to do is that to have data so data is very important 
part in the machine learning as we have to find the production o rules on the basis of machine learning algorithm so we are 
going to need data to train and data to play with in order to test the data

so any algorithm in machine learning is irrelevent if you dont have the proper dataset inoder to run that algorithm and
maximize the throughput you can get with the that machine learning algorithm

source of data :

1) company
2) Some entity or organisation 
3) from data scrapping from internet
4) from internet sources like kaggle, github and such like that
5) you can able to create own dataset
6) UCI Ml here people stores the machine learning information for future development

it is good idea to learn the dataframe and use the dataframe as its alternative is one which has something like 2d list and 
is very terrible idea in order to study data and it make functionality more complex and it is also to bad to deal with in point
of time and space complexity 


so in order to learn more about the machine learning you must have to know some libraries so we take dive in learning them 
and after that we can be able to use the modules in proper way 

so this is end of basis
